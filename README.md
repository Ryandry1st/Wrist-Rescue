# Wrist-Rescue
Platform is a device which is able to use resource efficient machine learning to predict whether an elderly user has fallen.
Data is collected using a prototype setup with an Arduino, which is fed to a computer to create and test the algorithm.
The process of the data analysis can be followed in the jupyter notebook "Data Analysis".
Finally, code is translated into C for the ATSAMD10D14 platform.
